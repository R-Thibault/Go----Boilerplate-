# Go----Boilerplate-

Boilerplate for a Go project using Gin and Gorm. This setup also includes Lefthook for managing Git hooks and Air for development purposes.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure the following are installed on your machine:

- [Golang](https://golang.org/dl/) version 1.22 or higher
- A PostgreSQL database
- A Go dependency manager (Go Modules is recommended)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/R-Thibault/Go----Boilerplate-
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Go----Boilerplate-
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies using Go Modules (or another dependency manager):

   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

4. Set up the environment variables as needed (e.g., for database connection). You can copy the `.env.sample` file, rename it to `.env`, and add your environment variables, or you can set the environment variables directly:

   ```bash
   export DB_USER=your_database_user
   export DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
   export DB_NAME=your_database_name
   export DB_HOST=your_database_host
   export DB_PORT=your_db_port
   ```

## Usage

### Starting the Application

To start the application:

```bash
go run *.go
```

### Starting the Application with Air (for Development)

Air is a Go utility that monitors code changes and automatically restarts the server, making it ideal for development.

To add the `air` command to your PATH:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

Then, run Air to start the application in development mode:

```bash
air
```
